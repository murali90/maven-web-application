
You need to download apache tomcat 8 and unzip by using tar –xvzf 

To start tomcat go to bin dir inside tomcat and ./startup.sh 

To check tomcat is up or ps –ef | grep tomcat and check port number 8080 

 
By default tomcat uses 8080 but Jenkins uses 8080 so u nedd to change the port number for tomcat ,u can change it by editing the server.xml in connector section (line number 69 in file)and  change the port number and stop tomcat and start the tomcat 

To shutdown ./shutdown.sh 
 
Now give permissions for startup.sh so that any user start up the tomcat ..dont give full permisiions in organization 

chmod +x startup.sh
chmod +x shutdown.sh

Creating soft link for startup .sh  and shutdown.sh 

ln -s /opt/tomcat-8.5.49/bin/startup.sh /usr/local/bin/tomcatup ------for starting tomcat 

ln -s /opt/tomcat-8.5.49/bin/shutdown.sh /usr/local/bin/tomcatdown  ---for stopping tomcat 


for tomcat logs  /opt/tomcat/logs/catalina.out


tomcatup but page not loading for my centos 7 

iptables -I  OUTPUT -o -enp0s3 -d 0.0.0.0/0 -j ACCEPT
iptables -I  INPUT -i -enp0s3 -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
iptables -I INPUT -j ACCEPT

and try to login  now 403 acces denied because we didn’t give permmison for tomcat users to login so give permission by doing following things 
cmd :find / -name context.xml 

output :/opt/tomcat-8.5.49/conf/context.xml
/opt/tomcat-8.5.49/webapps/host-manager/META-INF/context.xml
/opt/tomcat-8.5.49/webapps/manager/META-INF/context.xml


vi   /opt/tomcat-8.5.49/webapps/host-manager/META-INF/context.xml

comment the line number 19,20 as fallows
  19 <!--  <Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteAddrValve"
     20          allow="127\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+|::1|0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1" /> -->

vi /opt/tomcat-8.5.49/webapps/manager/META-INF/context.xml

19   <!-- <Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteAddrValve"
     20          allow="127\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+|::1|0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1" /> -->


Now to add user got to /opt/tomcat/conf

And edit tomcat-users.xml

vi tomcat-users.xml

and paste following under  second NOTE or  from line 36




<?xml version='1.0' encoding='cp1252'?>
